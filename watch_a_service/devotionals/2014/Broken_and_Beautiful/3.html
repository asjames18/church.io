<p>1 Corinthians 12:27 “All of you together are Christ’s body, and each of you is a part of it.”</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-12 “Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers. Their responsibility is to equip God’s people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ.”</p>
<p>In the immense tapestry that is God’s plan for man, each of our lives could be said to represent a thread, a part of the fabric and color of the whole. Even though we often stay focused on our own ‘strand’, we are also a part of the much bigger picture. While it is natural to focus on our gifts and how the Lord expects us to use them individually, it is also necessary we consider the part and role we play as believers that make up the body of Christ. While our gifts should identify us as followers of Christ to an unbelieving world, they also have a purpose within the family of believers. Describing us as everything from individual parts of a body to bricks in a building, the bible instructs us to see and consider our role in the community of faith. To the shepherd of each church is given a mission. And to fulfill that mission God places within that body of believers the necessary skills and talents to accomplish it (we are placed “as it pleases him”). That is why it is so important not to ‘forsake’ the congregation…because its success depends greatly on every piece being there to do what they do.</p>
<p>Prayer: “Father God, thank you for having a place for me within the family of faith. Help me remember today that others rely on what you have given me to make what we are all trying to do together work. It is not about me. It is about them. It is about you. Let me see enough of the picture so I know where it is I fit. In Jesus’ name, Lord, may it be according to your plan I humbly pray – Amen.”</p>

        	<h3 class="inner-sub-heading"><span>Thursday 1.23.14</span></h3>

<p>2 Peter 1: 5-10a “In view of all this, make every effort to respond to God’s promises. Supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone. The more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;But those who fail to develop in this way are shortsighted or blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their old sins. So, dear brothers and sisters, work hard to prove that you really are among those God has called and chosen.”</p>
<p>Developing our natural talents and gifts will never be more important than the spiritual development that must accompany it. Living in a physical world, it is sometimes too easy to get more focused on the physical and lose sight of the spiritual. The danger is that if your physical maturity (gifts) outpaces your spiritual maturity, it is too easy for the world to convince you to use your gifts for physical gain and personal fame than for its intended purpose. But as you develop spiritually in conjunction with your God-given talents, you will not fall into the trap of “forgetting that they (you) have been cleansed” from your former ways. The two processes are very similar. You start with faith and then add moral excellence (the framework in which you will exercise your gift), knowledge (you must learn, study and grow your gift), self-control (to maintain focus), patient endurance (as the Lord prepares you for the day he intends to unleash your gift), and godliness (remembering that all that we do is for the glory of our Heavenly Father). You are the chosen of the Lord for a specific purpose. Your gifts, perfected through diligence and exercised in spiritual maturity, is the mission upon which your very life was designed.</p>
<p>Prayer: “Heavenly Father, I know I need to grow spiritually as well as maturing my talents in the physical realm. My purpose should always be controlled by the knowledge that it is for our lives in the next world, and not this one, that I am called to labor. May the glory forever be yours as I submit&nbsp;all my endeavors to your guiding hand. In the matchless name of my dear brother Jesus’, I humbly pray it be so – Amen.”</p>

        	<h3 class="inner-sub-heading"><span>Wednesday 1.22.14</span></h3>

<p>2 Timothy 1: 6-7 “This is why I remind you to fan into flames the spiritual gift God gave you when I laid my hands on you. For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.”</p>
<p>It is not a coincidence that three key components to fulfilling God’s mission in your life are the very things the Spirit of God within you brings. If we are ever going to step out into this troubled world and face the enemy, we have to first overcome the presence of fear, that which holds so many believers back. Because the Spirit in us is greater than any spirit in this world, the knowledge of that power and strength gives us not only the courage but the ability to step out and accomplish. The Holy Spirit gives us the ability to love. Everything we do must be motivated by this or else our “successes” will be hollow and void of the very essence of our Heavenly Father. Lastly, he gave us a Spirit of self-discipline. If we are going to elevate our gifts to reach as far and as wide as God intends, it is going to take self-discipline. On our own, it is insufficient. We might start a work well…but eventually we lose interest, lose heart or lose faith. That is why it must be the Holy Spirit himself who leads the development of your talents and gifts – for only he can ensure it reaches its maximum potential.</p>
<p>Prayer: “Dearest Father, like so many things, my desire to please you and my ability to stay motivated and focused are not always the same. I need the help of the Holy Spirit to spur me on to be what you created me to be. Instead of trusting myself, I place those talents you have blessed me with in the Spirit’s capable hands – and ask him to give me the discipline I need to reach the heights you expect. In Jesus’ holy name I pray – Amen.”</p>

        	<h3 class="inner-sub-heading"><span>Tuesday 1.21.14</span></h3>

<p>Proverbs 18:16 “A man’s gift makes room for him and brings him before great men.”</p>
<p>Determining success in this life is not an easy thing. It takes many variables into account and depends greatly upon the scale you choose to use. It is not a science and therefore open to individual interpretation. When a goal is established, it becomes easier to define: did I achieve the goal or not? But what about success in life? If your objective is money, the Bible teaches you will never have “enough” gold and silver. If your objective is fame, how famous is famous enough? Is it in the weight of your possessions? How much stuff is enough? The truth is, God placed a gift inside of you – a deposit that is intended to be nurtured, grown and honed. It is tied directly to the purpose God intends for you. When you focus on building and using your gift, you will see your greatest “successes” in life. It does not mean you cannot find success in other areas of endeavor, but there is only so much life to be lived. If your goal is to fulfill your God-given purpose, you must be diligent in developing your gift – or run the risk of falling short of the destiny God intended for you.</p>
<p>Prayer: “Heavenly Father, I know that success for me will mean fulfilling the purpose for which you created me and you receiving the glory for it. I will know that I was successful when I stand before my Lord and Savior on that day and hear those words: “Well done, good and faithful servant.” In Jesus’ name, let my gift point forever towards you, Father – Amen.”</p>

        	<h3 class="inner-sub-heading"><span>Monday 1.20.14</span></h3>

<p>1 Samuel 16: 18-19 “One of the servants said to Saul, “One of Jesse’s sons from Bethlehem is a talented harp player. Not only that—he is a brave warrior, a man of war, and has good judgment. He is also a fine-looking young man, and the Lord is with him.” So Saul sent messengers to Jesse to say, “Send me your son David, the shepherd.”</p>
<p>Even at a young age, David had an impressive resume. He was a “talented harp player”, a “brave warrior, a man of war” (with a dead Philistine giant to add!), he was wise for his years (“good judgment”) and also “fine-looking “. And how was David choosing to make the most of all these obvious advantages? Job: Shepherd. It would be an understatement to say David was being ‘underutilized’. Although, in fairness, it was likely the long, lonely hours of shepherding that helped David perfect his playing (and singing). We know that his bravery and fighting skills were honed chasing off bears and lions from trying to steal his father’s sheep. It is strange that a man who would one day be known as Israel’s greatest king and a mighty man in battle (who slew his “ten-thousands”) cut his teeth with a club and slingshot while protecting sheep. Though you may not at the moment be working in your gifting, what have you been doing to ‘hone’ your skills for the moment when God finally opens the door for you to “sing for the king”? Opportunities abound for your talent to be used. It is transferable to many different contexts. And you take it with you wherever you go!</p>
<p>Prayer: “Dear Heavenly Father, I can use wherever I am to grow what you have given me. Whether I am simply sharpening my talent for later, or have been ‘lost’ in how to use what you gave me, thank you for helping me today to identify my talents, and see the possibilities to bring you glory. In Jesus’ mighty name I humbly pray – Amen.”</p>
