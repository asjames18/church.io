"Alex","Westbrook","alexwestbrookmusic@yahoo.com","1","Hi, my name is Alex Westbrook. I am a 22 year-old Worship Leader and Christian Artist from Nederland, Texas. I released my debut Contemporary Christian album ""Back To You"" in June 2013, and have been overwhelmingly blessed by the Lord to be able to do that. My band and I just finished our summer tour at the beginning of the month and we are currently in the process of booking dates for our ""Lost & Found"" fall tour. My band and I would love to make Praise Church Beaumont one of our stops this fall, and I hope to be able to continue talks with y'all about this possibility very soon! Please feel free to email me back at alexwestbrookmusic@yahoo.com. For info about my album ""Back To You"" and our ""Lost & Found"" tour, please visit my website at alexwestbrook.bandcamp.com and www.facebook.com/alexwestbrookmusic. Thank you so much for your time and God bless you all, our community, our nation, and the entire world.

- Alex Westbrook"
