<p>John 2:15-17 “Jesus made a whip from some ropes and chased them all out of the Temple. He drove out the sheep and cattle, scattered the money changers’ coins over the floor, and turned over their tables. Then, going over to the people who sold doves, he told them, “Get these things out of here. Stop turning my Father’s house into a marketplace!” Then his disciples remembered this prophecy from the Scriptures: “Passion for God’s house will consume me.””</p>
<p>In the gospel accounts of Jesus’ clearings of the Temple (one near the beginning of his ministry and one near the end), he is quoted as saying: “Stop turning my Father’s house into a marketplace” and “It is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer and you have made it a den of thieves”. Consider: Jesus had come to bring the kingdom of God down to man. The Temple, built by King Solomon, was patterned after the tabernacle of God in heaven (Heb. 9:23), the specific pattern and details having been given by God to King David (1 Chron. 28:11-19). And now we have men, self-serving and corrupt, using God’s “house” for personal gain. Jesus had a passion for the things of his Father – that is certain. Creation was made for man but the Temple was built so God could dwell among us. When Jesus saw it being used to cheat his people and for profit, his righteous anger let fly! Each Christian may feel a passion for one of the multitude of ways the depravity of man manifests itself. But all Christians should rise up passionately when the house of God becomes the target. Passion for the things of our Father’s house should also consume us.</p>
<p>Prayer: “Father God, I would not think twice about defending what is “mine”. And yet the things that you have taught us and entrusted to us are under attack everywhere in society today. As I am now your temple, it is up to me to passionately defend myself from what the world is trying to ‘pour’ into me or use me for. Your ways are under attack, Father. Give me the courage to defend what is ours. In Jesus’ most holy name I humbly pray – Amen.”</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 11: 24-28 “Five different times the Jewish leaders gave me thirty-nine lashes.&nbsp;Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. Once I spent a whole night and a day adrift at sea. I have traveled on many long journeys. I have faced danger from rivers and from robbers. I have faced danger from my own people, the Jews, as well as from the Gentiles. I have faced danger in the cities, in the deserts, and on the seas. And I have faced danger from men who claim to be believers but are not.&nbsp;I have worked hard and long, enduring many sleepless nights. I have been hungry and thirsty and have often gone without food. I have shivered in the cold, without enough clothing to keep me warm. Then, besides all this, I have the daily burden of my concern for all the churches!”</p>
<p>Passion will not only motivate you – but it will sustain you. Christianity, the life many ‘profess’ to follow, is a call to live outside oneself…beyond oneself. It is not a call to a life of ease. It is not a call to popularity. Persecution of followers of “the Way” has existed for as long as there have been followers. We have created a “Comfortable Christianity” that is a sham of the real thing. Why was Paul troubled at every turn? He was, perhaps, the greatest threat to the devil that ever existed! His passion drove him through whatever the enemy threw at him! Our enemy will not waste resources on those who are no threat. A “Christianity” that seeks ‘air-conditioned’ comforts and the safety of its own is certainly of little consequence. But when passion for the call of the Lord rises, it doesn’t matter if it points to the road uphill. Passion causes men who hide and deny they know the Lord to become men who proclaim his death and resurrection to the point of death by spear-point, crucifixion and torture. Men who will not be denied ‘the prize’. Passion says there is no sacrifice too great. That was Christ’s passion for us. That must be our passion for his call.</p>
<p>Prayer: “Heavenly Father, I can only imagine what I could have accomplished if I was as passionate about what you’ve called me to do as I have been in establishing my own comforts. Forgive me, Lord. Fire my passion to go and do – come what may. I know that on that road I will find my joy and your glory. In the matchless name of Jesus’, whom I follow and trust, I humbly ask it – Amen.”</p>

<p>1 Samuel 17: 26b “Who is this pagan Philistine anyway, that he is allowed to defy the armies of the living God?””</p>
<p>1 Samuel 17: 48 “As Goliath moved closer to attack, David quickly ran out to meet him.”</p>
<p>Nobody could ever accuse King David of not being passionate (a problem if that passion is not ‘God-driven’ as he would one day learn). He had a passion for the Lord his entire life. Even as a young shepherd, he exhibited a passionate personality, defending his flocks from both lion and bear; killing each to protect his family’s property when most shepherds would flee. With the Lord, there are no coincidences. It was not a coincidence that David just happened to be bringing his brothers lunch at the exact moment that Goliath walked out to defy God and the armies of Israel. David’s passion was inflamed as he heard his God being mocked by the 9-foot Philistine. All the Israelites could see was the giant. All passion could hear was the challenge. It was no coincidence that this shepherd, armed with a sling and stones, would kill the giant in full view of the army he would one day command. Something needed to be done. God used David’s passion (and his faith) to make it happen. Years later, would the army remember how David overpowered Goliath? Would they remember how he outmaneuvered him? No. They would remember the boy who “quickly ran” into battle against a giant – passionately trusting his Lord.</p>
<p>Prayer: “Lord Jesus, I’m sure when he first charged in, most in the army thought David reckless and foolish for allowing his “passions” to get the better of him. If I try to follow mine, I’m sure I will receive much of the same feedback. Give me the courage to ignore them, as David did, and passionately strike a blow for my God against our enemy! Ask our Father for his blessing in this, Lord, and ask it in your name – Amen.”</p>

        	<h3 class="inner-sub-heading"><span>Tuesday 1.14.14</span></h3>

<p>Nehemiah 1:11 “O Lord, please hear my prayer! Listen to the prayers of those of us who delight in honoring you. Please grant me success today by making the king favorable to me. Put it into his heart to be kind to me.”</p>
<p>Nehemiah’s passion for God’s city and his people was such that it wasn’t enough to just shed tears over the situation. It was not enough to simply pray to God and fast (although those are never insignificant things). Nehemiah had already purposed in his heart to take action. Something had to be done. Nehemiah did not have all the skills needed to solve all the problems facing Jerusalem and the Jews. But as cupbearer, he did have the ear of the king. In fact, being in the position of assuring the king wasn’t poisoned by being the first to drink from his cup, you might say he was in a unique position to make his request. He wanted to go back…he needed to take action. He would face dangers on the journey there and after arriving. None of that mattered. The task was a “logistical” nightmare – it didn’t matter. Nehemiah knew he had to do something. That is what passion can do – drive us to act. It becomes that nagging thought that won’t go away. It becomes the uneasiness that will not allow us to sit still. Passion alone may not be enough to guarantee you success. But it will be enough to fire you out the door.</p>
<p>Prayer: “Heavenly Father, I know I don’t need to be fired out of a cannon, but I also know that I have allowed things like self-doubt to keep me from allowing my passions to spur me to action. I know the passion is there. Lord, give me just enough passion to take the first step. It is always the hardest. In Jesus’ name I ask it Father, for with you I can make a difference because with you all things are possible – Amen.”</p>

        	<h3 class="inner-sub-heading"><span>Monday 1.13.14</span></h3>

<p>Nehemiah 1:3-5 “They said to me, “Things are not going well for those who returned to the province of Judah. They are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem has been torn down, and the gates have been destroyed by fire.” When I heard this, I sat down and wept. In fact, for days I mourned, fasted, and prayed to the God of heaven.”</p>
<p>Finding the purpose for which God created you is not always as difficult as it may seem. Your purpose will require certain gifts or talents which you would have been designed with. Finding out the “who” of your purpose will tell you how to apply the “what” that you most likely already know. The key indicator of your “who” is passion. Passion, an emotion-driven force, is that thing, that group of people, or that cause which gets your “blood pumping”. That thing that you can’t talk about without excessive use of exclamation points! What moves you to tears? To anger? To action? That is where your passion lies. In the case of Nehemiah, it was the plight of his people. Just hearing about the conditions of God’s city and the disgrace and trouble of the people brought him to tears. It “drove” him to mourn, fast and pray. It wasn’t simply a “oh, that is so sad” kinda thing. It broke his heart. He knew something had to be done. What are you passionate about? I’m not talking about a favorite restaurant or dessert…what injustice in this world, what specific group of suffering people, what deplorable situation just makes you want to cry out? Passion found points to purpose.</p>
<p>Prayer: “Dear Heavenly Father, I know sometimes our passion is dropped on us from you. At other times it simply arises from within because of how you made me. Regardless of whether mine is given or recognized, help me to identify mine so that I have a direction in which to set out in finding your purpose for me. In Jesus’ gracious name I humbly pray – Amen.”</p>
